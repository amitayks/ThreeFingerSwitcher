## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Tunable gesture parameters
The system SHALL expose tunable parameters with sensible defaults: activation threshold, axis-lock ratio, step distance ("one window per N"), wrap-vs-clamp at list ends, direction (natural/reverse), velocity smoothing factor, and exact-three-fingers requirement.

#### Scenario: Defaults applied on first run
- **WHEN** the app runs for the first time
- **THEN** all tunables have sensible default values and the switcher is usable without configuration

#### Scenario: Changing step distance changes stepping
- **WHEN** the user increases the step distance
- **THEN** more finger travel is required to advance the selection by one window

#### Scenario: Direction inversion
- **WHEN** the user sets direction to reverse
- **THEN** sliding right moves the selection in the opposite direction from the natural setting

### Requirement: Persisted settings
The system SHALL persist settings across launches and apply them immediately when changed.

#### Scenario: Settings survive restart
- **WHEN** the user changes a setting and relaunches the app
- **THEN** the changed value is retained

#### Scenario: Live application
- **WHEN** the user changes a tunable while the app is running
- **THEN** the new value takes effect on the next gesture without requiring a restart

### Requirement: Settings UI
The system SHALL provide a Settings UI to view and edit all tunables, reachable from the status menu.

#### Scenario: Open settings from menu
- **WHEN** the user selects Settings from the status menu
- **THEN** a Settings window opens showing all tunables with their current values

#### Scenario: Reset to defaults
- **WHEN** the user chooses to reset
- **THEN** all tunables return to their default values
